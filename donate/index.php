	<meta name="description" content="Grace, a recently engaged woman and a to-be commercial airplane pilot, receives a surprise visit when her ex-fiancé Jericho's mother comes to see her. The visitor delivers two shocking news to Grace: Jericho, who is a Navy SEAL, has died on a mission  – and has cryopreserved his sperm to Grace. The encounter brings strong and bittersweet memories, and suddenly Grace, who is in her late 30s, has to decide what she really wants in her life.">
