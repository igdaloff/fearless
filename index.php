				<h3>The Story</h3>
				<p>Glider pilot Grace Collins finds her life at a crossroads when Jericho Rhodes, her ex-fiancé, wills her his cryo-preserved sperm following his death while fighting in Afghanistan. Recently engaged to adventure writer Vaughn Clover, Grace finds herself torn between a bright future and forgotten passions. Confronted with the dilemma of a lifetime, Grace must decide what she values most.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Director's Statement</h4>
			<p>As human beings, we always carry our history with us. Memories can be our most precious treasures or a burden that is overwhelmingly heavy to carry – or both. Most of our memories are about other human beings. To our main character Grace, the most hidden and protected memories are about the greatest love and the greatest sorrow of her life – an ex-fiancé and a special forces soldier named Jericho.</p>
			<p>Our story takes place in wartime America, the present day America, where Grace's life is affected by Jericho's unexpected death. She must now make choices concerning her career, her love, and her desire for children.</p>
			<p>Life is full of choices, and we make decisions on a daily basis. Some decisions are small, some are life-changing. Many times, big decisions need a lot of courage. I personally believe that since we only have one life, we should always live fully and honestly to ourselves and to other people. We must have the courage to follow our hearts and to do the right thing. This is the ultimate battle, not some war in a distant country.</p>

			<h3>About the AFI Conservatory</h3>
			<div class="afi-quote">
				<p>"Art is a nation's most precious heritage. For it is in our works of art that we reveal to ourselves, and to others, the inner vision which guides us as a nation, and where there is no vision, the people perish. We will create an american film institute, bringing together leading artists of the film industry, outstanding educators and young men and women who wish to pursue the 20th century art form as their life's work."</p>

			<p>Consistently regarded as one of the top film schools in the world, the American Film Institute Conservatory has been training award-winning filmmakers since its establishment in 1969. As part of the American Film Institute's dedication to preserving and expanding America's film heritage, the Conservatory's Masters of Fine Arts program is highly selective and provides a unique hands-on approach that provides students an opportunity to produce more films than any other graduate film program. The two-year Master of Fine Arts program emphasizes narrative visual storytelling and personal expression and culminates with the collaboration of fellows from the six disciplines — Cinematography, Directing, Editing, Producing, Production Design and Screenwriting — on a thesis film produced in a professional-style environment.</p>
			<p>AFI thesis films have garnered numerous prestigious awards, including several Oscar nominations, the Oscar for best narrative short, the Student Oscar, the Director's Guild of America Awards, several American Society of Cinematography Awards, and top honors from the American Cinema Editors.</p>
			<p>Traditionally AFI thesis films are instrumental in launching its fellows' careers in film.</p>
